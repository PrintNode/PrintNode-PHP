// Include the autoloader
// To include all the PrintNode PHP API classes in your own code, all you need to do is 
// include/require the autoload.php in your code:

include 'vendor/autoload.php';
include 'credentials.php';

// Open a connection to PrintNode
// You first need to establish a connection to PrintNode. 
// This can be done by using a PrintNode\ApiKey instance using your api-key.

$credentials = new PrintNode\Credentials();
$credentials->setApiKey($config['PRINTNODE_APIKEY']);

// Hint: Your API username is in the format description.integer, where description 
// is the name given to the API key when you created it, followed by a dot (.) and an integer. 
// All this information is provided for you when you create your API Key.

// Step 3: Get a list of computers, printers or printjobs which are available.
// To get a list of computers, printers or printjobs, create a new PrintNode\Request 
// object, passing it your credentials as the argument to it's constructor.

$request = new PrintNode\Request($credentials);

// Hint: Before you can get a list of computers or printers, you must have successfully 
// connected using the PrintNode Client software. If you have not yet connected with 
// the client software you will not receive any results from the API.

// Call the getComputers, getPrinters() or getPrintJobs() method on the object:
$computers = $request->getComputers();
$printers = $request->getPrinters();
$printJobs = $request->getPrintJobs();

// Hint: The return value from these methods is always an array containing 0 or more 
// instances of PrintNode\Computer, PrintNode\Printer or PrintNode\PrintJob depending 
// on the method called. You can iterate over this array however you please, for example 
// you might use a while or foreach loop.

// Step 4: Send a PrintJob to Printnode.
// PrintNode currently only accepts PDF documents. 
// To print something, you need to create a new instance of PrintNode\PrintJob:

$printJob = new PrintNode\PrintJob();

// You can then populate this object with the information about the print-job 
// and add the base64-encoded content of, or the URI to your PDF. To do this use the properties 
// as defined on the object. 
// 
// In this example, we're going to print a a base64-encoded PDF named invoice.pdf:

$printJob->printer = $printers[1];
$printJob->contentType = 'pdf_base64';
$printJob->content = base64_encode(file_get_contents('a4_portrait.pdf'));
$printJob->source = 'My App/1.0';
$printJob->title = 'Test PrintJob from My App/1.0';

// Hint: The PrintNode PHP API comes complete with PHPDoc comments. 
// If you have an editor that supports PHPDoc code completion, you should see hints 
// for the properties and method names on each of the objects.

// Once you have populated the object, all that's left to do is submit it:
$response = $request->post($printJob);

// The response returned from the post method is an instance of PrintNode\Response. 
// It contains methods for retrieving the response headers, body and HTTP status-code and message.

// Returns the HTTP status code.
$statusCode = $response->getStatusCode();

// Returns the HTTP status message.
$statusMessage = $response->getStatusMessage();

// Returns an array of HTTP headers.
$headers = $response->getHeaders();

// Return the response body.
$content = $response->getContent();
